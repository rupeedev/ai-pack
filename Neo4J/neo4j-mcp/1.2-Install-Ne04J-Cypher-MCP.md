# Installing the Neo4j Cypher MCP server

In the previous lesson, you learned how to configure an MCP server in Claude Desktop.

In this challenge, you will install the Neo4j Cypher MCP server to VS Code and configure it to connect to your Neo4j database.

## Get started

The repository,** **[neo4j-graphacademy/genai-mcp-neo4j-tools](https://github.com/neo4j-graphacademy/genai-mcp-neo4j-tools), has been created for this course. It contains any starter code and resources you need.

You can use a** **[GitHub codespace](https://github.com/codespaces) as an online IDE and workspace for this course. It will automatically clone the course repository and set up your environment.

[Open in GitHub Codespace](https://github.com/codespaces/new/neo4j-graphacademy/genai-mcp-neo4j-tools)

GitHub Codespaces

You will need to login with a GitHub account. The** **[GitHub Codespaces free monthly usage](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-your-products/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces#monthly-included-storage-and-core-hours-for-personal-accounts) will cover the duration of this course.

The setup instructions in the README will be open automatically when you open the Codespace.

Your environment variables required for step 2 can be found further down this page.

GitHub Codespace

You can keep the Codespace open while completing the course. You can open your existing codespaces at** **[github.com/codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces).

## Interacting with Neo4j

To interact with a Neo4j database, we can use the** **[Neo4j Cypher MCP Server](https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/mcp-neo4j/tree/main/servers/mcp-neo4j-cypher). This server is one of a number of** **[MCP servers offered by Neo4j](https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/mcp-neo4j). When configured with environment variables that point to a Neo4j database, the server will enable the host to:

* Obtain the schema of the database
* Execute Cypher statements that** ***read* and** ***write* data to the database

The server is written in Python, so you will use the** **`uvx` command to install the server from PyPI and run the server locally, and configure VS Code to communicate with the server using the Standard Input/Output (stdio) transport method.

## Installing and Configuring the Neo4j Cypher MCP Server

To configure the Neo4j Cypher MCP server to connect to your Neo4j instance, copy the complete configuration below into the** **`.vscode/mcp.json` file in your Codespace:

json

.vscode/mcp.json

Copy

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "neo4j-cypher": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-neo4j-cypher"
      ],
      "env": {
        "NEO4J_URI": "bolt://13.222.233.93:7687",
        "NEO4J_USERNAME": "neo4j",
        "NEO4J_PASSWORD": "pane-shortages-packs",
        "NEO4J_DATABASE": "neo4j"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This definition instructs VS Code to use the** **`uvx` command to run the** **`mcp-neo4j-cypher`. The** **`env` section configures the environment variables to connect to your database.

Using VS Code MCP Commands

You can use the VS Code** ****MCP: Add Server** command to create the initial configuration, then add the environment variables manually.

## Verify your installation

To verify that the server is installed correctly, you can use the Command Palette to execute the** ******MCP: List servers**** command.

![MCP: List servers](https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/genai-mcp-neo4j-tools/1-what-is-mcp/4c-install-mcp-neo4j-cypher/images/mcp-list-servers.jpg)

You should see a server named** **`neo4j-cypher` in the list.

Select the server and then** ** **Start Server** . VS Code will connect to the server and pull the description of the tools available.

If you ask Copilot which MCP tools are available, you should get a list containing three tools. Open the Copilot chat window by executing the** ****Chat: Open Chat (Agent mode)** command in the Command Palette or accessing the three line menu, selecting** ****View** and then** ** **Chat** .
