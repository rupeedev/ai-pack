# Reading the Graph Schema

In this challenge, you will use the Neo4j Cypher MCP server installed in** **[Installing the Neo4j Cypher MCP server](https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/genai-mcp-neo4j-tools/1-what-is-mcp/4c-install-mcp-neo4j-cypher) to explore the movies database schema.

If you haven’t already completed this lesson, please do so now.

Otherwise, let’s get started!

## How to complete this challenge

Your goal is to find out** ****which outgoing relationships go from a User node** in the movies database.

### Step 1: Open VS Code Copilot

In VS Code, open the Copilot chat window.

Ensure that the chat is in** ****Agent mode** by selecting the** **`Agent` option in the bottom left hand corner of the chat window.

### Step 2: Ask About User Relationships

Ask Copilot the specific question:

text

Copy

```text
What outgoing relationships does the User node have?
```

### Step 3: Review the Response

Copilot will use the** **`get-neo4j-schema` tool to examine the database schema and provide information about User node relationships.

If you have followed the instructions correctly, you should now see a response from Copilot that answers the question.

## User Node Relationships

After exploring the database schema, what outgoing relationship does a User node have in the movies database?

* [ ] `WATCHED`
* [ ] `RATED`
* [ ] `LIKED`
* [ ] `REVIEWED`
* [ ] `FOLLOWS`
* [ ] 
* [ ] 
* [ ] 
* [ ] 
* [ ] 

# Generating Cypher Statements

Now for another challenge.

Your goal is to find out** ****which movie has the highest IMDB rating** in the movies database.

You can repeat the steps from the previous challenge, instead asking for the highest rated movie and its IMDB rating.

Ask Copilot the specific question:

text

Copy

```text
Which movie has the highest IMDB rating, and what is its rating?
```

Copilot will use the** **`read-neo4j-cypher` tool to generate and execute a Cypher query to find the movie with the highest IMDB rating.

If you have followed the instructions correctly, you should now see a response from Copilot that answers the question.

Non-null properties

The** **`imdbRating` property does not exist for all movies in the database. This is treated by Neo4j as a** ** *null property* , which are treated as the lowest possible value when ordered in descending order.

You may need to instruct Copilot to only return movies with a non-null** **`imdbRating` property.

## Highest Rated Movie

After generating and executing a Cypher query, what is the** ****rating** of the highest rated movie?

* [ ] 9.8
* [ ] 9.6
* [ ] 9.4
* [ ] 9.2
