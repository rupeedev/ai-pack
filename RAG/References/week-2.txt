Pre-Read (Start Here)

Before watching the Week 2 videos, please go through the following resources.
They will give you the right mental model for how real production data ingestion pipelines are built for RAG systems.


1️⃣ Week 2 Blog: Bringing Your RAG System to Life

This blog explains how we transform Week 1’s infrastructure into a real, automated system by:
fetching daily arXiv papers
parsing scientific PDFs reliably
running ingestion via Airflow
storing structured metadata for search

Read it here:

2️⃣ Week 2 Code Repository (Clone the Week 2.0 Release Only)

To follow exactly what appears in the videos, please clone only the Week 2.0 release — not the main branch.


🔽 Download the tagged release

👉 https://github.com/jamwithai/arxiv-paper-curator/releases/tag/week2.0

OR clone it directly with git:
git clone --branch week2.0 https://github.com/jamwithai/arxiv-paper-curator

This ensures:
You get the precise version used in Week 2
No future changes break your setup
All DAG and parsing files match the videos exactly


Folder locations you will use:

airflow/dags/arxiv_paper_ingestion.py - Week 2 DAG
src/services/arxiv/ - API client + factory
src/services/pdf_parser/ - Docling parsing logic
notebooks/week2/ - PDF parsing + ingestion debugging notebook


3️⃣ What You Should Know Before the Videos

RAG starts with data engineering, not embeddings.
Week 2’s focus is on building a reliable ingestion pipeline, because without clean, structured data → retrieval & generation fail.
arXiv API enforces strict rate limits (3 seconds).
Scientific PDFs are messy - Docling helps structure them properly.
Airflow gives you automation, reliability, and traceability.

In Week 2, you will build:

Automated arXiv ingestion service
Airflow DAG scheduled daily
Docling-based PDF parser
Metadata extraction + structured storage
Error-tolerant ingestion architecture

This pipeline becomes the data foundation for Week 3 (search), Week 4 (chunking + vectors), and the complete RAG pipeline in Weeks 5 and 6.
