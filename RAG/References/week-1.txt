Pre-Read (Start Here)

Before watching the Week 1 videos, please go through the following resources.
They will give you the right mental model for how real production RAG systems are built.


1️⃣ Week 1 Blog: The Infrastructure That Powers RAG Systems

This explains why we start with infrastructure before touching embeddings, chunking, or LLMs.
Read it here:
https://jamwithai.substack.com/p/the-infrastructure-that-powers-rag

2️⃣ Week 1 Code Repository

Full Week 1 codebase with Docker, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, OpenSearch, and Airflow setup:
https://github.com/jamwithai/arxiv-paper-curator

Navigate to:
docker-compose.yml - complete infra stack
src/ - API structure (routers, services, repositories)
notebooks/week1/ - interactive setup walkthrough

3️⃣ What You Should Know Before the Videos

RAG doesn’t start with embeddings - it starts with infrastructure
Week 1’s goal: get all core services running cleanly
If your Docker or service health is unstable → RAG will break later
You will build:
FastAPI backend
PostgreSQL + migrations
OpenSearch cluster
Airflow scheduler
Ollama LLM service

This is the foundation the entire 6-week system relies on, so please complete the pre-read before starting the videos



==========================

🏗️ Architecture Overview

  The Week 1 RAG system uses a layered architecture:
  FastAPI Routers (API Layer)
      ↓
  Dependency Injection
      ↓
  Repository/Service Layer
      ↓
  Database/External Services

  📁 Key Components

  1. Main Entry Point

  src/main.py:1 - FastAPI app with lifespan management for service initialization

  2. Database Layer

  - Model: src/models/paper.py:1 - Paper schema with arXiv metadata
  - Repository: src/repositories/paper.py:1 - CRUD operations
  - Factory: src/db/factory.py:1 - Database abstraction

  3. API Endpoints

  - src/routers/ping.py:1 - Health checks (GET /ping, /health)
  - src/routers/papers.py:1 - Paper operations (GET /papers/{arxiv_id})
  - src/routers/ask.py:1 - Q&A endpoint (POST /ask) - Mock only in Week 1

  4. Configuration

  src/config.py:1 - Pydantic settings loaded from .env

  🔄 Data Flow Example

  HTTP GET /papers/2401.00001
      ↓
  Router (papers.py) → Inject DB session
      ↓
  PaperRepository.get_by_arxiv_id()
      ↓
  SQLAlchemy query → PostgreSQL
      ↓
  PaperResponse schema → JSON response

  🐳 Docker Services

  | Service               | Port  | Purpose                         |
  |-----------------------|-------|---------------------------------|
  | api                   | 8000  | FastAPI application             |
  | postgres              | 5432  | Paper metadata storage          |
  | opensearch            | 9200  | Search engine (used Week 3+)    |
  | opensearch-dashboards | 5601  | Search UI                       |
  | airflow               | 8080  | Workflow automation             |
  | ollama                | 11434 | Local LLM server (used Week 5+) |
