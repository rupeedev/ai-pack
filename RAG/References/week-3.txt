Pre-Read (Start Here)

Before watching the Week 3 videos, please go through the following resources.

They will give you the right mental model for how production keyword search is built before hybrid RAG systems.


1️⃣ Week 3 Blog: The Search Foundation Every RAG System Needs

This blog explains how we move from raw ingested data (Week 2) to reliable search by:

creating a clean OpenSearch index
understanding BM25 keyword ranking
building a proper search API
adding filters & scoring logic

2️⃣ Week 3 Code Repository (Clone the Week 3.0 Release Only)

To follow exactly what appears in the videos, please clone only the Week 3.0 release — not the main branch.

🔽 Download the tagged release

👉 https://github.com/jamwithai/arxiv-paper-curator/releases/tag/week3.0

Or clone it directly:
git clone --branch week3.0 https://github.com/jamwithai/arxiv-paper-curator

This ensures:
you get the exact version used in Week 3
index & search logic match the videos
no future changes break your setup

Folder locations you will use:
src/services/opensearch/ - search service
src/routers/search.py - search API
notebooks/week3/ - OpenSearch + BM25 notebook

3️⃣ What You Should Know Before the Videos

RAG works only when retrieval works.

Week 3 focuses on building a strong keyword search layer, because without precise keyword retrieval → hybrid search, chunking, and RAG quality all drop.

In Week 3, you will build:
a production OpenSearch index
BM25-based keyword retrieval
a search API with filters
structured queries with scoring

This search foundation becomes the base for Week 4 (chunking + hybrid search), Week 5 (RAG), and Week 6 (monitoring + caching).
