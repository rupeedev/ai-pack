Before watching the Week 4 videos, please go through the following resources.

They will give you the right mental model for how chunking + hybrid search turn basic keyword search into a truly intelligent retrieval system.

1️⃣ Week 4 Blog: The Chunking Strategy That Makes Hybrid Search Work

This blog explains how we move from Week 3’s BM25 search into semantic + keyword hybrid retrieval by:
applying structured chunking
generating high-quality embeddings
combining BM25 + vectors using RRF
building a unified hybrid search API

2️⃣ Week 4 Code Repository (Clone the Week 4.0 Release Only)

To follow exactly what appears in the videos, please clone only the Week 4.0 release - not the main branch.

🔽 Download the tagged release
👉 https://github.com/jamwithai/arxiv-paper-curator/releases/tag/week4.0

Or clone it directly:
git clone --branch week4.0 https://github.com/jamwithai/arxiv-paper-curator

This ensures:
You get the exact version used in Week 4
Chunking + embedding logic match the videos
No future changes break your setup

Folder locations you will use:
src/services/indexing/text_chunker.py
src/services/embeddings/
src/routers/hybrid_search.py

3️⃣ What You Should Know Before the Videos

Hybrid search is only effective when both sides - keyword and semantic are clean and well-designed.

Week 4 focuses on building the semantic layer of your RAG system by introducing chunking and embeddings.

In Week 4, you will build:

a section-aware text chunker
a production embeddings pipeline
a hybrid search service using RRF
a unified search API that supports all modes

This hybrid layer becomes the core of Week 5 (RAG pipeline) and Week 6 (monitoring + caching)
