## Session 1 - 2025-12-01

**Focus:** Git initialization and Week 1 setup

**Major Changes:**
- Initialized git repo, pushed to github.com/rupeedev/rag-training (853 files)
- Created root .gitignore for security
- Started Week 1 services (all 6 healthy: API, PostgreSQL, OpenSearch, Airflow, Ollama)
- Created CLAUDE.md and docs/ structure (7 documentation files)

**Key Decisions:**
- Single unified repo (not submodules) for easier learning
- Root-level .gitignore in addition to week-specific
- Docs/ directory for session continuity (CURRENT_STATE, SESSION_HANDOFF, Journal)

**Blockers/Issues:** None

**Next:** Begin Week 1 learning path
