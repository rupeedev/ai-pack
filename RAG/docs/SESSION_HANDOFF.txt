# SESSION HANDOFF - RAG Training Project

Session Date: 2025-12-01
Session Duration: ~2 hours
AI Assistant: Claude Code (Sonnet 4.5)

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Repository Initialization
- Initialized git repository in /Users/rupeshpanwar/Documents/AI-Projects/RAG/
- Removed nested .git repositories from week directories (main/, week-1/ through week-7/)
- Added remote: git@github.com:rupeedev/rag-training.git
- Created initial commit with all project files (853 files)

### 2. Security Configuration
- Created root-level .gitignore to protect sensitive data
- Verified no .env files with credentials were committed
- Only safe template files (.env.example, .env.test) are in repository
- Added protection for: .env, credentials, secrets, tokens, API keys

### 3. Documentation Created
- Created CLAUDE.md with comprehensive project documentation
- Documented architecture, development commands, technology stack
- Added code generation guidelines and best practices
- Included weekly progression structure

### 4. Environment Setup
- Resolved port conflicts (PostgreSQL 5432, Airflow 8080)
- Started Week 1 Docker Compose services successfully
- All services running and healthy:
  - FastAPI (8000)
  - PostgreSQL (5432)
  - OpenSearch (9200, 5601)
  - Airflow (8080)
  - Ollama (11434)

### 5. Codebase Understanding
- Conducted comprehensive analysis of Week 1 architecture
- Documented layered architecture pattern (Router → Service → Repository → DB)
- Identified key components and data flow patterns
- Analyzed Docker Compose multi-service setup

### 6. GitHub Push
- Successfully pushed to GitHub: https://github.com/rupeedev/rag-training
- Branch: main (tracking origin/main)
- Commit: 690cbcd

### 7. Documentation Structure
- Created /docs directory
- Created CURRENT_STATE.txt
- Created SESSION_HANDOFF.txt
- Created security/ subdirectory

## Current State

### What's Working
- Git repository initialized and pushed to GitHub
- Week 1 services running successfully
- Security properly configured (no sensitive data in git)
- Comprehensive documentation in place

### What's Pending
- Complete docs/ folder structure
- Additional reference documentation files
- Update CLAUDE.md with docs references

### Active Environment
- Working Directory: /Users/rupeshpanwar/Documents/AI-Projects/RAG/
- Active Week: week-1 (services running)
- Services Status: All healthy

## Context for Next Session

### User Goals
- Learning RAG systems through hands-on implementation
- Understanding production-grade architecture patterns
- Building from Week 1 foundation through Week 7 advanced features

### Project Context
- This is a learning project with 7 progressive weeks
- Each week directory is self-contained with its own implementation
- main/ directory contains the most complete implementation (Week 7)
- User is currently exploring Week 1 to understand foundations

### Important Files
- /Users/rupeshpanwar/Documents/AI-Projects/RAG/CLAUDE.md - Project guide
- /Users/rupeshpanwar/Documents/AI-Projects/RAG/week-1/compose.yml - Week 1 services
- /Users/rupeshpanwar/Documents/AI-Projects/RAG/week-1/README.md - Week 1 setup guide

### Commands Used This Session
```bash
# Port conflict resolution
lsof -i :5432
lsof -i :8080
docker stop [container_id]

# Git operations
git init
git remote add origin git@github.com:rupeedev/rag-training.git
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit..."
git push -u origin main

# Service management
cd week-1
docker compose up --build -d
docker compose ps
make health

# Directory operations
mkdir -p docs/security
```

### Next Steps Suggestions
1. Continue exploring Week 1 codebase
2. Work through Week 1 notebook: notebooks/week1/week1_setup.ipynb
3. Test API endpoints at http://localhost:8000/docs
4. Move to Week 2 when ready
5. Complete documentation structure setup

## Questions to Ask Next Session

If user continues with Week 1:
- "Would you like to explore specific Week 1 components (routers, services, models)?"
- "Ready to test the API endpoints?"
- "Want to work through the Week 1 Jupyter notebook?"

If user wants to progress:
- "Ready to move to Week 2 (data ingestion)?"
- "Need help stopping Week 1 and starting Week 2 services?"

## Important Notes

- User prefers clean commit messages (no emoji footers)
- User is security-conscious (asked about .gitignore before push)
- Project uses UV package manager (not pip/poetry)
- Each week requires different .env configurations
- Services take 2-3 minutes to fully start up

## Session Statistics

- Files committed: 853
- Documentation files created: 3
- Services configured: 6
- Ports resolved: 2 (5432, 8080)
- Git operations: 5 (init, remote add, add, commit, push)
